### Hi there 👋

I'm Angela Martin, a curious data analyst based in London. Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you will find a collection of my projects, contributions, and explorations in the world of code.

### About Me

### Featured Python Projects

#1. "Financial calculator" 
I developed a versatile Python program that serves as both an investment calculator and a bond repayment 
estimator. For the investment calculator, users input the principal amount, interest rate, and investment duration, 
and the program calculates either simple or compound interest based on user preference. The bond repayment 
estimator allows users to provide the present value of a bond, annual interest rate, and months until maturity, 
with the program computing the monthly bond repayment amount. This project demonstrates my proficiency in 
handling financial calculations, implementing input validation, and creating practical tools for financial decisions 
using Python. 

#2. “Triathlon Award Calculator"
I created a Python program called “Triathlon Award Calculator”. This project showcases my data analysis skills by 
processing user input for swimming, cycling, and running event times. It accurately calculates the total time taken 
to complete the triathlon and determines the appropriate award category based on the qualifying criteria. The 
program demonstrates my ability to handle data, make informed decisions, and create practical solutions.
